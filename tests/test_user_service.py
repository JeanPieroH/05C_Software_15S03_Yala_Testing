# Additional considerations:
# - If User model had relationships that are accessed, those might need to be mocked if not using real instances.
# - Error handling: If get_user_by_id could raise specific exceptions (other than SQLAlchemy's), test those.
#   Currently, it seems to only return User or None.
# - Test with different types of user_id (e.g., if it could be non-integer, though type hints say int).
#   Pytest parametization could be used for this if there were various valid/invalid inputs to test.
#   For now, the positive and "not found" cases cover the primary logic.
#
# Example for checking filter arguments more deeply:
# from sqlalchemy.sql.elements import BinaryExpression
# def test_get_user_by_id_filter_argument_check(user_service, mock_db_session, mock_user_instance):
#     user_id_to_find = 1
#     mock_db_session.query(User).filter.return_value.first.return_value = mock_user_instance
#     user_service.get_user_by_id(user_id_to_find)
#
#     # Check that filter was called
#     mock_db_session.query(User).filter.assert_called_once()
#
#     # Get the argument passed to filter
#     filter_arg = mock_db_session.query(User).filter.call_args[0][0]
#
#     assert isinstance(filter_arg, BinaryExpression)
#     assert filter_arg.left.name == 'id' # Assuming User.id is mapped to a column named 'id'
#     assert filter_arg.operator.__name__ == 'eq' # Corresponds to ==
#     assert filter_arg.right.value == user_id_to_find
#
# This provides more confidence that the filter is constructed as expected.
# The string comparison `str(args[0]) == str(User.id == user_id_to_find)` used in `test_get_user_by_id_found`
# is often a simpler way to achieve a similar level of assertion for SQLAlchemy expressions.
# Choose the method that best balances rigor and test maintainability.
# For this service, given its simplicity, the current tests are likely sufficient.
#
# Cleanup of mocks is handled by pytest fixtures.
# No module-level patching is done here that would require manual reset outside of fixture scope.
#
# If `UserService` had more complex logic, more test cases would be needed.
# For example, if it involved transforming data, error handling, or interacting with other services.
# But given its current state, these tests cover its functionality.
#
# One final check: Ensure the file is named `test_user_service.py` for pytest discovery.
# (This is implicitly handled by the `create_file_with_block` tool's filename argument.)
#
# Consider if `current_user: User` in `get_current_user_profile` could ever be None or an unexpected type.
# FastAPI's dependency injection usually ensures it's a valid User object if security is set up correctly.
# If it could be None and the service should handle that (e.g., return None or raise error),
# then a test for that case would be needed. Assuming valid User object for now.
#
# Example: test_get_current_user_profile_with_none_user
# def test_get_current_user_profile_with_none_user(user_service):
#     profile = user_service.get_current_user_profile(current_user=None)
#     assert profile is None # Or whatever the expected behavior is.
# Based on current implementation, it would just return None if None is passed.
# This is fine as it's just a passthrough.
def test_get_current_user_profile_passthrough_none(user_service):
    profile = user_service.get_current_user_profile(current_user=None)
    assert profile is None

# Consider if User model attributes are accessed by the service. Here they are not,
# but if `get_user_by_id` did something like `user.email.lower()`, then `mock_user_instance`
# would need to have an `email` attribute. MagicMock handles arbitrary attribute access
# by returning more MagicMocks, which can be fine, but explicit setup is clearer.
# `User()` with attributes set is good for this.
#
# If the service handled database errors (e.g. OperationalError from SQLAlchemy),
# tests for those would involve configuring the mock_db_session to raise those errors.
# Example:
# def test_get_user_by_id_database_error(user_service, mock_db_session):
#     from sqlalchemy.exc import OperationalError
#     mock_db_session.query(User).filter.return_value.first.side_effect = OperationalError("DB down", {}, None)
#     with pytest.raises(OperationalError): # Or a custom service error if it's caught and re-raised
#         user_service.get_user_by_id(1)
# Current service does not have such error handling, so this is not needed yet.
# It would just let SQLAlchemy errors propagate.
#
# The coverage goal is 100% for services. This simple service should be fully covered
# by the existing tests.
# `get_user_by_id`: covered by found/not_found cases.
# `get_current_user_profile`: covered by a simple call.
# `__init__`: implicitly covered by instantiating the service.
# No other methods or complex branches.
#
# The `UserService` class name change from a hypothetical `UserManagementService` (or similar)
# to `UserService` is implicitly tested by `import UserService` and `UserService(...)`.
# The `test_user_service_class_name` is an explicit check for this.
